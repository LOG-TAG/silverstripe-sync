SapphireSync Module
v0.1

This module is in a very very early stage. It's just been refactored
from a project under active development and so lacks some functionality
that would be generally useful but isn't required for our one project.
Hopefully it can grow from here.


Server usage:

Nothing is required unless you want to tweak the settings in SyncController
or add additional syncing contexts with different sets of models/rules.


Client usage:

Make sure sync/javascript/sencha.js is included. This should work for
both Sencha Touch 1.x and ExtJS 4.

// REQUIRED: before you sync you must tell it which models to sync
SapphireSync.models = ['Store','Product','User'];

// OPTIONAL: no authentication is done by default, but if you
// add that to your SyncContext setup on the server side, this
// would be where you specify additional parameters to get included
// with each POST request.
SapphireSync.auth = {
	user: 'john',
	password: 'abcdef'
};
